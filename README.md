# Rest-with-NodeJs-API-with-Express-and-MySQL
Hello guys! I'm Dani 


Node Js 


I will create an API that will follow the rest pattern and will use Node Js, Express and MySQL to save the data. 

This API will have several data, so I'll be able to save the service with the client's name, the pet we will attend, the service performed, the status of this service, observations and the dates of the appointment and when it was saved in the database.   


I will follow the rest pattern, I will create a semantic API with get, post, put, patch, delete and we can organize our code better. I will use some libs, controllers, model and by the end of this course I will have an API created from scratch.
